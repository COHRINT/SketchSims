SRC:
simulator.py: Main file. Run with arguments for number of sims and tag
POMCPSolver.py: used by simulator, online solver
dataCheck.py: analysis of collected data for various tests, makes figures
sketchGen.py: Makes and augments sketches, answers questions about them when asked
roadNode.py: creates and updates the simulated target models, creates the road network
treeNode.py: node class used by POMCP for planning
softmaxModels.py: implements softmax functions
gaussianMixtures.py: implements Gaussian Mixtures
humanEmulator.py: Not Used, ended up doing it all in sketchGen.py, didn't get rid of it for reasons of vague unease

DATA:
Folder storing all the data from testing, files named for test variable and parameters


FIGS:
Created Figures

IMG:
Images used for interface and sanity tests such as test_image_overlay.py

YAML:
config files containing locations of landmarks and roadnetwork intersections

SPECS: 
Folder contains problem specifications
graphSpec.py: The problem in the thesis, with all the parameters and generators functions to make POMCP and simulator go
gridSpec.py: older version of the thesis problem using cardnial actions instead of graph movements. Lame and boring
